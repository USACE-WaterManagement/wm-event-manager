### Local Development Setup

#### Critical URLs
page | url
---- | ---
ElasticMQ Web Interface | http://localhost:9325
Minio Web Interface | http://localhost:9001
Web Dev Server | http://localhost:5173
Swagger Docs | http://localhost:8000/docs
Redoc | http://localhost:8000/redoc

#### Python
For the best experience, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended for install instructions.  If pyenv is available, the `setup-pyenv.sh` script is provided to create a virtual environment and install the necessary local dev requirements. Be sure to install `gcc` for your environment.

#### Authentication
By default, the local instance of the API uses a mock user account.  This account has script-execute permissions for all districts.  As a result, the API will return scripts for all offices that contain a corresponding script catalog within the minio instance.

#### Script Containers
The API will reference district script docker images that exist locally by the name `[office-code]-jobs`, e.g. `lrh-jobs`.  These can be created by cloning the corresponding district jobs repo, e.g. [lrh-wm-cwbi-jobs](https://github.com/USACE-WaterManagement/lrh-wm-cwbi-jobs), and building the images from the local dockerfile with `docker build . -t [office-code]-jobs`.

#### Script Catalogs
Available district scripts are managed within the cwms-batch application itself using the "Scripts Manager" available through the Web UI or directly through API endpoints.

#### User Interface
The user interface is deployed locally as a vite development server.  To run it, simply enter the `ui` directory and run `npm run dev`.
