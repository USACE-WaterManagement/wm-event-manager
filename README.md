# cwms-batch-events

CWMS Batch Events provides users an API and user interface to execute water management jobs on a manual or event-driven basis.

### GitHub Codespaces

The repository's development container prepares a complete environment for GitHub Codespaces, including Python 3.12 and all test dependencies, Node.js 22 and the UI dependencies, Docker Compose with an isolated Docker daemon, the external `cwms` Docker network required by the local stack, and editor support for Python, TypeScript, ESLint, and Docker.

Create a Codespace for this repository and wait for its setup to finish. The mounted checkout is used directly for Python imports, and `ui/node_modules` is installed from the committed lockfile. No credentials or repository secrets are required for the default mock-user development flow.

Verify the environment with:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
npm --prefix ui run lint
npm --prefix ui run build
docker compose config --quiet
```

Start the local service stack and UI in separate terminals:

```bash
docker compose up --build
npm --prefix ui run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

Codespaces forwards the UI, API, MinIO console, and ElasticMQ UI ports automatically. Use the forwarded URLs shown in the **Ports** panel rather than assuming `localhost` from outside the Codespace.

#### Run the Dev Container locally on Windows

Install and start Docker Desktop in Linux container mode, and ensure Node.js and npm are available. From a PowerShell prompt at the repository root, build and start the development container on the local Docker host with:

```powershell
npx -y @devcontainers/cli up --workspace-folder .
```

Open a shell in the running development container with:

```powershell
npx -y @devcontainers/cli exec --workspace-folder . bash
```

Docker Desktop runs the development container itself. The development container's Docker-in-Docker feature provides the isolated Docker daemon used by the project's Compose stack.


### Local Development Setup

#### Critical URLs
page | url
---- | ---
ElasticMQ Web Interface | http://localhost:9325
Minio Web Interface | http://localhost:9001
Web Dev Server | http://localhost:5173
Swagger Docs | http://localhost:8000/docs
Redoc | http://localhost:8000/redoc

#### Python
For the best experience, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended for install instructions.  If pyenv is available, the `setup-pyenv.sh` script is provided to create a virtual environment and install the necessary local dev requirements. Be sure to install `gcc` for your environment.

#### Authentication
By default, the local instance of the API uses a mock user account.  This account has script-execute permissions for all districts.  As a result, the API will return scripts for all offices that contain a corresponding script catalog within the minio instance.

#### Script Containers
The API will reference district script docker images that exist locally by the name `[office-code]-jobs`, e.g. `lrh-jobs`.  These can be created by cloning the corresponding district jobs repo, e.g. [lrh-wm-cwbi-jobs](https://github.com/USACE-WaterManagement/lrh-wm-cwbi-jobs), and building the images from the local dockerfile with `docker build . -t [office-code]-jobs`.

#### Script Catalogs
Available district scripts are managed within the cwms-batch application itself using the "Scripts Manager" available through the Web UI or directly through API endpoints.

#### User Interface
The user interface is deployed locally as a vite development server.  To run it, simply enter the `ui` directory and run `npm run dev`.
